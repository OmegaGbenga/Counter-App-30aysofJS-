# Counter App - Day 1: 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge

## Overview
This is a simple Counter App built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as part of the **30 Days of JavaScript Challenge**. On Day 1, the goal was to build a functioning counter application where the user can increment, decrement, and reset the counter value.

### Features:
- **Increment**: Increases the counter by 1 when the "+" button is clicked.
- **Decrement**: Decreases the counter by 1 when the "-" button is clicked (with a check to ensure the counter doesnâ€™t go below 0).
- **Reset**: Resets the counter to 0 when the reset button is clicked.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used to create the basic structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styled the app with basic styles to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: The logic for the counter's functionality, including the increment, decrement, and reset actions, is powered by JavaScript.

## How It Works
1. When the user clicks the **Increment** button (`+`), the counter increases by 1.
2. When the user clicks the **Decrement** button (`-`), the counter decreases by 1, but it will never go below 0.
3. When the **Reset** button is clicked, the counter resets to 0.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OmegaGbenga/Counter-App.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Counter-App
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the app.

### Files in this Project
- **index.html**: The HTML file contains the structure for the app's user interface (UI).
- **main.js**: The JavaScript file contains the logic for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter.
- **style.css**: The CSS file adds some styling to the app, including the layout and color scheme.

### Future Enhancements
- Add styling for better UI/UX.
- Implement local storage to save the counter value even after the page is refreshed.
- Add animations for button clicks or counter changes.
